summary: Climate change has become an increasingly present issue in society and is attributed to the developments of climate change that have led to warmer temperatures. Yearly higher temperatures have had an impact on our everyday lives. This creates worse and more frequent weather catastrophes along with warmer waters, and melting ice caps in the Arctic which leads to higher sea levels. High sea levels intrude onto land, removing space for housing, agriculture, and changing the ecosystem. Some states have acknowledged the harmful effects of climate change and have legislation to mitigate the effects of climate change, such as clean energy goals. However, some states do not have any initiatives. It's important to be aware of the impacts of climate change and commit to mitigation efforts.
