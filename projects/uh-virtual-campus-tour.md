summary: "As of Fall 2022, the University of Hawaii at Manoa (UHM), had a virtual campus tour comprised of YouTube videos along with a third-party application that describes the buildings. By the UHM having a tour, it allowed for the university to be more accessible to out-of-state and neighboring island residents who are not able to visit campus. Therefore, my team and I created a virtual campus tour with the idea of it being 'for students by students.â€™"
