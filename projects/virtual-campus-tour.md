summary: "As of Fall 2022, the University of Hawaii at Manoa (UHM), had a virtual campus tour comprised of YouTube videos along with a third-party application that describes the buildings. By the UHM having a tour, it allows for the university to be more accessible to out-of-state and neighboring island residents who are not able to visit campus. Therefore, my team and I created a virtual campus tour with the idea of being 'for students by students.’"

During my first semester of college, I was assigned to write a Literature Review for my Introduction to Research class (HON 101). For my paper I had chosen to research and write about how Technology Affects Compassion. By growing up in the Okinawan community it has allowed me to talk and interact with people of different generations and different backgrounds. Therefore, it allowed me to notice the difference in generations and how they behave and exhibit compassion which could be attributed to the introduction of technology. 

Furthermore, upon completion of this class I was encouraged to publish my piece in the Horizon’s Undergraduate Journal at the University of Hawaii at Manoa by my Professor Dr. Jayme Scally. This led me to revise my literature review to make it more encompassing of the different perspectives of how technology has affected the development of compassion. Through this process I learned that although I may have an opinion, it is important to bring out both sides of the argument and analyze them equally and effectively to let the reader choose. Also I learned the importance of explaining the context of when the piece was written, since the presence of COVID-19 led for the research of the piece to be relevant since the majority of people were participating, doing things online and continuing to mitigate the spread of the virus. I also learned the importance of readability, for the audience to be able to read the material no matter what backgrounds. 

Through this first publication, I was able to learn the importance of the publication process and the process of ensuring that all relevant information behind the topic is covered, to bring more credibility behind the piece.
