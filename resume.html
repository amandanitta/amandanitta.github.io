              <p class="mb-0">In Hawaii, the computer science proficiency in our secondary schools is falling behind the national average/ proficiency. Therefore, I worked in a team of 5 to create/ develop a curriculum to help bring the computer science competency in Hawaii to the national standard. The curriculum developed had aids of real world examples to help with memory retention and to understand application of computer science principles. Computer science principles that I had created curriculum on, were for bootstrapping a computer, binary numbers, loops, data wrangling, origins of the internet/ computer science, data types, programming basics/ essentials, sorting and searching and the responsibility of a computer scientist. While creating the curriculum, I was fortunate to teach at a local middle school. The curriculum that was developed will be used to teach primarily middle school students for years to come.</p>

              <p class="mb-0">Irei No Hi is known as Okinawa's Memorial day that serves as a day in Okinawa to pay tribute to the hardships and lives lost during the Battle of Okinawa in World War II. I volunteered and co-chaired the production of a video of about 2 hours for the Hawaii United OKinawa Association's tribute. This tribute is usually put on by 40-50 year olds, however I co-led a team of 6 college-aged individuals in creating this tribute. The video has over two thousand views on Facebook and Youtube combined and is being shown to university/ high school students in Okinawa by their teachers. This video serves as an example/ role model to the Okinawan community that although being generations from immigration and as college students engrossed in other activities, we still care about preserving and perpetuating the culture. My team and I conducted interviews and research along with breaking down the civilian stories to make it relevant to our generation and why it's important to continue to remember these experiences and the importance of peace.

            <p class="mb-0">Technology is becoming increasingly prevalent in society, where especially in recent times, virtually the majority of tasks, meetings, and schooling are carried out through online formats. This piece aims to address the negative and positive effects that technology introduces and is increasingly prevalent in our society. These findings were analyzed through the analysis of literature. These studies are able to show how technology has brought about convenience but also has impacted the development of interpersonal and intrapersonal characteristics with particular emphasis on compassion and empathy. The studies analyzed were mainly based within the European Union, but can be further applied to other societies and the world.

The testing process included demonstration of sets of different techniques followed by memory recitation of multiple passages that range from definition of patterns from white belt to black belt, along with describing morals and understanding of the role of a martial artist. Throughout my journey I have been able to learn valuable life lessons that stem from the principles of modesty, courtesy, integrity, self control, perseverance and indomitable spirit. </p>
