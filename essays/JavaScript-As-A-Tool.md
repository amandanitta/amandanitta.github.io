*Java Scipt serves as a tool in developing valuable skills*

To code it requires an individual to be able to critically think to solve the problem at hand. Athletic Software Engineering allows for an individual to practice solving problems efficiently and effectively within a time constraint under pressure. Through this practice, it allows for an individual to prepare their mindset to think and critically evaluate the problem to get to a solution. It further helps bring the intuition to where to start problems and break the issues down easily. The concepts of Athletic Software Engineering can be further applied to other branches of computer science to teach individuals how to think critically and efficiently. 

##Athletic Software Engineering##

Through Athletic Software Engineering, JavaScript has allowed me to learn and realize the importance of practicing different aspects and methods to learn how to code effectively. This can be attributed to JavaScript not having variable declarations that are strict and allows for more malleability in the problem solving and leads for there to be less confusion with errors of wrong data types. JavaScript creates a good venue to learn and transcend my computer science knowledge and how to code more efficiently.

The athletic software engineering practice through having timed practice problems with work familiar with the problem at hand and the way to solve the issue, or being able to critically think about the issue at hand in a short period of time. By practicing athletic software engineering through daily timed problems allows me to learn how to code efficiently and effectively with logic. Therefore, these problems are useful to me in getting my mindset to be able to approach the problem and determine a solution in the most effective and efficient way. Although there is some stress with striving to finish the problem within the time designated, it allows me to think critically under stress and wanting to read the question and do exactly what I have been told and not diverging. 

Furthermore, through the athletic software engineering principles and using javascript it has allowed me to further my competency in being able to program and code under pressure and time constraints. It also furthers my individual desire to want to be more efficient and effective with code.
