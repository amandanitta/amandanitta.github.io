*How to give back to the University of Hawaii community*

## Overview

The University of Hawaii at Manoa (UHM) has undergraduate and graduate degree programs. There are over 13,000 students who apply to attend the university each year, composed of students who are based on Oahu - where the university is located - along with outer island residents and mainland/international students. These students want to determine whether UHM is the best fit for their college experience and the way they do that is by visiting the campus in-person.

As of Fall 2022, UHM only has a YouTube video that acts as the virtual campus tour. Since Hawaii is located far away from most other major colleges, prospective students have to make a choice to either visit locally situated colleges, or fly out to UH to take an in-person tour of our campus. Thus, it would benefit UHM to create a virtual campus tour, and our team aspires to bring this dream to reality. Through our project idea of creating a virtual campus tour we strive to make UHM more appealing to these students who are not able to visit or would like to get an idea of campus before they come to a physical campus tour.

## Mock-Up Page Ideas

In our application we will be having a landing page, it will look similar to STAR GPS where there will be a “Start New Experience” button along with log-in information so people can fitter what they may be interested in learning about UHM. Following the landing page, after creating an account to go back inside into the system and setting up their initial preferences. It will proceed to give general information about the University along with major specific or interest specific information such as with clubs or ongoing research that is happening. The application will allow for the preferences to be possible.

To make our application the most appealable for the different audiences, we plan to have different roles such as prospective students who want to learn about the campus, parents who want to learn more about the campus, current students who want to learn more about campus/ where buildings are located, and administrators to update information to keep it up to date. For each audience, in the preferences for instance for the students they can filter by interest of Japanese such as looking at Moore Hall and seeing the classes and Clubs that help to bring fellowship amongst the students. Another instance would be computer science where there is an ICSpace for students to study and clubs that they can join including the Association for Computing Machinery and Grey Hats. Each page for the students, created will be where we generally show information specific to a club/ building/ major. There will also be a page for financial aid and scholarships that UHM offers.

In this project idea, currently we are planning to make one for the Computer Science department and in the future to branch out to the College of Natural Sciences and the other colleges that make up the University of Hawaii campus.

## Beyond the Basics

There will be a system to filter the information per student and save their preferences so that they are able to go back to their saved searches and also continue to search in other areas. There will be a long tour and a short tour with both relevant information per individual and how it works. There will also be a system for students to request real tours along with a feature to see other things that may be of interest to them such as the beaches that are near and accommodations, financial information, scholarships and other student life opportunities.
