*Collaboration between individuals allow for dreams to come true*

## Collaboration is indispensable  

In projects, individuals often collaborate in the development of projects. In order for these projects to succeed it is crucial that everyone is able to proceed under a similar standard, expectation and goal, so that if an individual is not able to fulfill their responsibilities there are minimal problems or learning curves in the transition. Furthermore, in coding and the computer science field specifically, it is important for people to adhere to similar coding standards to ensure readability and the continuation of the project in the future. 

## Coding Standards serve as a foundation and key to success 

There are various ways for different groups to organize their code or to ensure that all collaborators are under a similar impression. The maintenance of these standards can be implemented through having all collaborators using similar configurations such as ESLint.  In exploring the coding standards of ESLint that can be embedded with IntelliJ, it has been able to ensure maintenance of code by running errors if the standards are not followed and forcing individuals to write in a particular format. Although determining the cause of errors from the ESLint may be frustrating due to it being very precise, it allows all individuals to have a code that is readable by everyone. By everyone being able to read the code and have expectations in the long-term, it allows for problems to be addressed in a more optimal time. Therefore, while it may be a nuisance in the moment as an individual progresses in their tasks, it allows for the maintenance of information and finding solutions effectively when problems or shifts in individuals occur.

Through the establishment of precedent with these coding standards it further allows for individuals to collaborate at a more efficient pace with the code being a similar format. Without the coding standard of ESLint, for instance, ensuring that the indentation was adequate for the situation, individuals may not be able to read or process the different coding blocks efficiently or get a good grasp of the code to provide feedback or make revisions/ edits when problems arise since a substantial amount of time may be devoted to understanding what is happening. With the assistance of ESLint, it helps to eliminate the barrier of understanding formatting of when things begin and start. Therefore, it is quintessential when working with individuals that despite not exactly finding coding standards to be the best thing, in the long term it allows for individuals to assist and make useful comments/ suggestions about the code.

## Foundation being important for success 

Coding standards are able to serve as a foundation for those in the computer science field, since collaboration is critical when working with individuals to ensure that all aspects are considered and covered so the project can succeed. It enhances the ability for people to work effectively in the process of creating projects and setting an expectation for everyone. Although a nuisance to find the errors in the moment, it is important to note that in the field and the broader society it is very rare for individuals to do projects solo that make a direct impact on people and rather is propelled by a group of people. So collaboration and setting expectations is important in order for projects to succeed.
