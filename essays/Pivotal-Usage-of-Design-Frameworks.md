*Learning something pays off in the end*

## Foundations Serve As A Consistency  

For simplicity, there are frameworks that are applied and created in user interface design to assist in creating web pages that have some uniformity in the sense of margins and the way things are formattedly laid out. Commonly in the field of website design, User Interface Frameworks more known as “UI Frameworks” are implemented by software engineers who build websites to make their sites more aesthetically pleasing along with assisting in making their life easier in creating formatting. This can be acquainted with having a set of different classes such as ‘containers’ for marginal consistency. Using these frameworks assist in creating a less frustrating person while working in theory, since these frameworks apply a certain set of foundations that could be implemented with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), although it would be immensely time consuming and mind straining hours of attempting to format. Through the usage of UI frameworks, it is pivotal. However, it is only pivotal and better if an individual is aware of the foundations of the UI framework. Without the knowledge, this could bring about more frustration since the learning of the framework while doing the task is immensely difficult.

## Steep Learning Curve 

In the experience of learning and using Bootstrap 5, it was immensely difficult to use and frustrating to look at the documentation and be more confused. There were classes that were not explicitly defined and required a lot of background knowledge to be able to apply when comparing to what ideally should have been used. Although there are many ways to do programming and there are multiple solutions to a single problem, there are solutions that require background knowledge which comes from experience with the framework in this instance.

## Once Learn Fundamentals, Makes Life Easier 

However, when looking at the website as it was being built with the frameworks frustration increased. It was very interesting to see how these classes in the UI framework were able to serve as a foundation to making the page seamlessly uniform where not much thinking was required to write the CSS file. The UI framework allowed ease in formatting and allowed for things to be centered and within the requirements of expectations when the correct class was used for the right element. Thus, despite there being a tremendous amount of stress and a learning curve behind the application and using of the bootstrap 5 UI framework, in the end, it saves hours of frustration in uniformly formatting and less lines of code/ words to make the pages. 
If all the webpages were built exclusively using raw HyperText Markup Language (HTML) and CSS, this would lead to individuals formatting single elements multiple times and attempting to make every element align nicely with each other, while in UI frameworks it could simply be done by a class. Raw HTML and CSS also do not create functional websites with ease with dropdowns or navbars and are harder to make aesthetically pleasing to the consumer. Using the HTML and CSS in exclusivity leads to  increased difficulty in the implementation of design of pages while also being more mind draining in attempting to make it user friendly.

## Learn Fundamentals, Makes Life Easier 

Despite UI frameworks having a tremendous learning curve that is similar to learning a new programming language, It allows individuals when they are relatively competent in the understanding of the different classes to be more capable of implementing websites that are user friendly, aesthetically pleasing, and uniformly formatted with ease. These frameworks allow for the creation of websites to be more tailored towards appeasing the general public. Without the usage of the UI frameworks, it would lead individuals to spend a lot more time on the formatting and be a lot more frustrated. Thus, the UI frameworks although tremendously difficult allows for immense satisfaction in the end with implementing things with ease.
