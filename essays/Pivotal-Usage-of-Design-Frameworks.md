*Learning something pays off in the end*

##Foundations Serve As A Consistency  

For simplicity, there are frameworks that are applied and created in user interface design to assist in creating web pages that have some uniformity in the sense of margins and the way things are formattedly laid out. Commonly in the field of website design, User Interface Frameworks more known as “UI Frameworks” are implemented by software engineers who build websites to make their sites more aesthetically pleasing along with assisting in making their life easier in creating formatting. This can be acquainted with having a set of different classes such as ‘containers’ for marginal consistency. Using these frameworks assist in creating a less frustrating person while working in theory, since these frameworks apply a certain set of foundations that could be implemented with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), although it would be immensely time consuming and mind straining hours of attempting to format. Through the usage of UI frameworks, it is pivotal. However, it is only pivotal and better if an individual is aware of the foundations of the UI framework. Without the knowledge, this could bring about more frustration since the learning of the framework while doing the task is immensely difficult.

## Coding Standards serve as a foundation and key to success 

There are various ways for different groups to organize their code or to ensure that all collaborators are under a similar impression. The maintenance of these standards can be implemented through having all collaborators using similar configurations such as ESLint.  In exploring the coding standards of ESLint that can be embedded with IntelliJ, it has been able to ensure maintenance of code by running errors if the standards are not followed and forcing individuals to write in a particular format. Although determining the cause of errors from the ESLint may be frustrating due to it being very precise, it allows all individuals to have a code that is readable by everyone. By everyone being able to read the code and have expectations in the long-term, it allows for problems to be addressed in a more optimal time. Therefore, while it may be a nuisance in the moment as an individual progresses in their tasks, it allows for the maintenance of information and finding solutions effectively when problems or shifts in individuals occur. 

Through the establishment of precedent with these coding standards it further allows for individuals to collaborate at a more efficient pace with the code being a similar format. Without the coding standard of ESLint, for instance, ensuring that the indentation was adequate for the situation, individuals may not be able to read or process the different coding blocks efficiently or get a good grasp of the code to provide feedback or make revisions/ edits when problems arise since a substantial amount of time may be devoted to understanding what is happening. With the assistance of ESLint, it helps to eliminate the barrier of understanding formatting of when things begin and start. Therefore, it is quintessential when working with individuals that despite not exactly finding coding standards to be the best thing, in the long term it allows for individuals to assist and make useful comments/ suggestions about the code.

## Foundation being important for success 

Coding standards are able to serve as a foundation for those in the computer science field, since collaboration is critical when working with individuals to ensure that all aspects are considered and covered so the project can succeed. It enhances the ability for people to work effectively in the process of creating projects and setting an expectation for everyone. Although a nuisance to find the errors in the moment, it is important to note that in the field and the broader society it is very rare for individuals to do projects solo that make a direct impact on people and rather is propelled by a group of people. So collaboration and setting expectations is important in order for projects to succeed.
