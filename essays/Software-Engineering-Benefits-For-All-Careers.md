*Software Engineering a beneficial skill set*

Software engineering encompasses a multitude of different aspects that allows for the development of design, testing and maintenance of software applications. Therefore, having a background in the mechanisms and concepts behind software engineering allows for individuals to be more equipped to see the process from the beginning to the end, along with learning how to problem solve issues in the most efficient and timely manner. It allows for a concise thought process of the path forward. This mindset of software engineering allows for individuals to be more conscious and diligent about decisions in an effort to remain efficient. 

With the background of software engineering, it allows for there to be understanding in the team of the whole picture and all the aspects involved. Those without the background may find it difficult to understand certain deeper level aspects that are not usually dealt with in their work. The unique mindset and diversity of software engineers allows for the exhibition of increased mobility and refinement of the project to make it encompass the different goals/ standards and target audiences. 

## Software Engineering Further Applications

Therefore, on my personal journey through computer science, the concepts of software engineering will help to propel my endeavors and equip me with valuable life lessons and skills to strengthen my background to contribute more to projects. Software engineering, although being a separate branch than my focus of Data Science, allows me to think holistically about the different aspects involved rather than only on the synthesis of information. It helps me to be more aware of the processes behind the foundations of data science and can help me be a more efficient programmer with seeing all the different procedures needed to get to the end product of the synthesis of information.

Software engineering provides a very unique skill set and background to an individual and makes them  realize the holistic approach towards the end product along with the details. The mechanics can be applied to the further fields of computer science that are beyond software engineering such as Data Science and Cyber Security. The systematic approach to development entails serving as a possible leader in a group or being able to participate in larger meetings to ensure everything is on the same page, and also ensures that the most efficient route is being taken.
