date: 2021
published: true
labels:
  - Publication
summary: "Technology is becoming increasingly prevalent in society, where especially in recent times,
the majority of tasks, meetings, and schooling are essentially carried out through online
formats. This article aims to address the negative and positive effects that technology
introduces and how it has become common in our society. The findings were analyzed
through the analysis of literature. These studies are able to show how technology has
brought about convenience but also has impacted the development of interpersonal and
intrapersonal characteristics with particular emphasis on compassion and empathy. The
studies analyzed were mainly based within the European Union, but can be further
applied to other societies and the world."
