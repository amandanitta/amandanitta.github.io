summary: "Students tend to pursue post secondary education with the perspective that gaining these credentials allows them to be more employable. Thus, the examination of salaries and personal fulfillment allows for students to understand how alumni perceive their post secondary education success. The objective of this study is to understand how University of Hawaiʻi (UH) alumni fare post graduation in Hawaiʻi compared to those in the continental United States (US), US Census Bureau data, and student perception of their post-graduation prospects. This study entailed a survey being sent out that consisted of various questions surrounding demographics, campus attending, latest/current degrees in progress, and occupational details (e.g. salary, place residing, etc.). Upon data collection, all data was anonymized and all salaries were considered with inflation. Furthermore, data science principles were used to conduct the comparison and aggregate statistical analysis. The majority of alumni data collected can be noted to be statistically similar compared to the US Census Bureau data. It can also be observed that those who currently work in Hawaiʻi have more personal fulfillment in their careers. The student perception demonstrates a desire to stay in the islands, but the salary expectations differ. These findings demonstrate how UH alumni fare in industry and allow for the community/administration to see how their students succeeded and how they perceived their career successes."
