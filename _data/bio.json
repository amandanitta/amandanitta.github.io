This article aims to address the negative and positive effects that technology introduces and is increasingly prevalent in our society. These findings were analyzed through the analysis of literature. These studies are able to show how technology has brought about convenience but also has impacted the development of interpersonal and intrapersonal characteristics with particular emphasis on compassion and empathy. The studies analyzed were mainly based within the European Union, but can be further applied to other societies and the world."
